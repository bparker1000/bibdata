"Bibliophilia" Google Books analysis for Data Science w/Dr. Caverlee, Spring 2013

In this project, we analyzed the Google Books Ngram corpus (specifically, the English One Million 5-grams) to find which grams were most popular. We also attempted to find interesting insights into changes in the popularity of given grams over time.

This git repository contains a reference file for the Hive queries we ran to extract our data, as well as the code used to create our visualization.
